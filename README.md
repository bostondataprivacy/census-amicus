# A Simple Simulation of a Random Guessing Attack

This repository provides the code used in the experiments reported in an amicus brief of data privacy experts.

To execute the code, either clone the repository or download it as a zip file. In the repository where you downloaded the code, run 

```python simple_sim.py```

at the command line. The code was tested with Python version 3.7.6. It will reproduce the simulation reported in the brief for Census blocks in Alabama which were reported to have between 0 and 49 residents in 2010 (divided into blocks with 0 to 9 residents and those with 10 to 49 residents).
